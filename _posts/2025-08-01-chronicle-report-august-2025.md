Our work centered on how new players learn to play StariumXCV. The Travellers Guide has been improved to provide a better path for beginners, while development on the new web client continued.

#### Travellers Guide Renovation
The Travellers Guide, our wiki, has undergone revision:

- New Look: Redesigned with a fresh, cohesive style that aligns with StariumXCV’s evolving identity and upcoming UI.

- Streamlined Navigation: Key links and categories have been reorganized so information is easier to find.

- Revamped Pages: The Main Page and Getting Started page now serve as clear entry points for learning how to play.

Some of the content is still under construction, and we’ll continue expanding it over the coming months.

#### User Interface: Foundations in Place
Last month, we announced the rebuild of the StariumXCV Web Client. Since then, we have:

- Completed the frontend structure, and began layering in the interactive features.

- Rebuilt how players log in

Here’s a sneak peek of our new UI:

The Travellers Guide is now a stronger resource for new players and progress on the new web client is moving forward steadily.
