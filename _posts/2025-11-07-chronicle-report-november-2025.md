We are getting ready to go live with the new website!

The new front-end is paying off and we’re excited to share what we’ve done so far.

To get the full context on the modern tech tools we’re using, and why we rebuilt, read our Insights article here: [Rebuilding the StariumXCV Web Client](https://blog.stariumxcv.com/2025/07/21/rebuilding-the-stariumxcv-web-client.html)

The updated StariumXCV website launches November 22 around 1pm EST 🚀 
Come chat with the devs on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JSB2CTV) as the site goes live!
