This August, the Gwythdarian team came together for our annual BBQ, a rare and wonderful chance to get together in person. Since we’re a fully remote team, most of our collaboration happens over video calls, chat windows, and cloud documents. But once a year, we gather to connect with everyone.

As usual, this year’s cookout was hosted by our COO, Tim, at his home on the shores of Lake Michigan. Our CEO, Jim, stepped into the role of “chef” and kept the grill busy with burgers and brats while the rest of us enjoyed the lake breeze.

We even had teammates fly in from across the country to join us. For some, it was the first time meeting face-to-face after months (or years!) of remote work together. Moments like these remind us why we do what we do. We’re grateful for the opportunity to celebrate not only the work, but also the people who make it possible.
