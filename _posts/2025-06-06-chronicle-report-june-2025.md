### Outreach and Orientation

We are executing a focused social media strategy to better connect with players, fans, and future explorers. At the same time, we’ve been improving how new players experience and navigate the StariumXCV universe.

#### Community Engagement
While our social profiles have been live for some time, this is the first month we’ve implemented a consistent, intentional engagement plan, and the results are insanity:

- Post engagements increased by 12,000%
- Reach expanded by 101,000%
- Reactions grew by 6,900%

We’ve been sharing dev updates, game lore, and design previews, and it’s clear people are tuning in. Our most engaged post reached 837 people with nearly 15% engagement. Not bad for liftoff!

#### Player Guidance
We’re also building a new set of visual tutorials to help new players get their bearings in the game.

Think of them as navigational beacons—clear, lightweight, and designed to ease new players into the game experience.

By aligning our content, tutorials, and outreach, we’re creating the conditions for long-term growth, and a smoother, more connected galaxy.
