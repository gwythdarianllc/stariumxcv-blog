A journey through the stars is never a straight path. Some stretches are quiet, engines humming as we prepare for what’s next. But progress never stops, and we have much to share.

While we haven’t been as active online, our dedication to StariumXCV has never wavered. Behind the scenes, development has been moving full speed ahead, and we’re excited to bring you back into the loop!

#### What’s Been Happening?

**Internal Playtesting is ENGAGED!** Systems are active, simulations are running, and gameplay optimizations are in progress. Every test brings us closer to delivering the experience we’ve envisioned.

**Merch Store is LIVE!** Want to rep the StariumXCV universe in the real world? We’ve launched our merch through Redbubble, and we’re eager to see how it performs across the galaxy. This is a new venture for us, so if you run into any issues, let us know! Visit [Our Redbubble Store](https://www.redbubble.com/people/gwythdarian/shop?asc=u) to gear up for the stars.

**Transmission Link is ACTIVE!** We’re re-establishing our communication channels with dev updates, behind-the-scenes intel, and community discussions. You’ve been part of this mission, now let’s navigate the next frontier together.

#### What’s Next?

Momentum is building, and we are committed to keeping you informed. Expect ongoing updates and mission logs straight from our dev team.

None of this would be possible without our community. Over the years, so many of you have contributed through design, development, feedback, ideas, playtesting, and unwavering support.

StariumXCV is more than just a game, it’s a universe shaped by those who believe in it. This is your game as much as it is ours, and together, we’re bringing this vision to life.

We’re here, we’re listening, and we’d love to hear from you. Join us in the general chat to share your thoughts, ask questions, or just connect!
