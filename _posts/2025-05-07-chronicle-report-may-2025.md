Inside Out: Interface, Infrastructure, Insights

The galaxy never stops expanding—and neither do we. Our systems are getting sleeker, smarter, and stronger. Here’s a look at this month’s highlights from the command deck.

### Current Operation: Better User Experience
We’ve been improving UI elements, smoothing out gameplay flow, and laying the groundwork for a smoother onboarding experience. Small tweaks with big impact. Playtesting is helping us find the rough spots in our user experience, and polishing this up will continue to be a big focus.

### Under the Hood: AWS Infrastructure Rebuild
AWS has been a great resources for us, and this month we've worked to leverage more of its features to make our game more stable and scalable. We've added more automated deployments to make applying patches easier, and we've re-worked our networking and compute so our servers are really easy to scale up or down as demand requires. 

### Introducing: Insights
We’re launching a brand-new blog series called Insights, a look at the systems, features, and design decisions that shape the StariumXCV universe. Insights will be longer posts that get to go more in-depth about parts of the game. The first one will be about what this game is and how you get started. You can expect to read it very soon!
