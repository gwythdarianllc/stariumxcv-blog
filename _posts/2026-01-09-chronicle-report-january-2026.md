Happy New Year from the StariumXCV team!

This month we are welcoming a new team member and expanding our marketing and social media activity to share more of our journey with you.

#### Team Update
We are excited to introduce Daniel, who is joining StariumXCV as a front-end developer, focusing on our new UI design and user experience.

He is excited to be working on StariumXCV and has already helped us improve our online presence. He recently built our company website, which you can check out here: [Gwythdarian Site](https://www.gwythdarian.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

We are thrilled to have him on board.

#### Marketing & Social Update
As we move closer to Alpha testing, we are shifting more attention toward sharing StariumXCV with a wider audience.

We are an indie team, which means we wear a lot of hats. One of our devs has officially put on their “marketing hat” to help us connect people who might enjoy a sci-fi strategy game that fits into real life.

Our goals are to:
 - Reach players who might be interested in StariumXCV
 - Share progress openly as development continues
 - Genuinely engage with our growing community, not just broadcast at you

We want our social presence to feel like an ongoing dev log and a community hangout, not just a one-way marketing channel.

To support this effort, we have launched some new places where you can follow us.
