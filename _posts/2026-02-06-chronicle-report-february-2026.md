We're making strong progress on multiple fronts this month, focused on getting StariumXCV ready for testing and making it look and feel good to play.

#### UI Development

We're taking a mobile-first approach, starting with the smallest possible screen size, which has been a genuine challenge given everything we need to fit in there. It's still a work in progress, but we're loving the direction it's heading. The general look and feel is exactly what we're going for, and now we're in the phase of filling it in and making everything function the way we want. By starting with the smallest screen constraints, we are making sure the core experience works everywhere, then we can build it up as screen real estate increases.

#### Promo Code System

We've developed a promo code system that will give us much better control over special access for players. This means when we get to testing, we'll have a streamlined way to grant game access. Down the road, we'll also use this system to distribute rewards to players.

#### In Progress

We're actively working on:
 - UI for interacting with game objects
 - Email mailing list for game updates
 - Reworking the Travellers Guide

The new year has us firing on all cylinders, and we’re excited to keep the momentum going.
