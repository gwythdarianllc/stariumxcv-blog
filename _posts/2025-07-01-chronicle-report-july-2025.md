From the systems that power StariumXCV to the channels that connect us to you, here's what we've been up to this month.

#### Procedural Generation
Genesis is our own custom-built procedural generation engine responsible for creating the galaxies of StariumXCV. We have been running and cleaning up the system, sometimes letting it churn for days at a time. It is now a more stable foundation for building the player experience.

#### Exploring Our Outreach
We are on LinkedIn. We are hoping to reach a professional audience that may not have the time to play other games. StariumXCV offers a convenient playing experience for busy people. You can now find and connect with us there.

#### What Is Coming
We have been working on some significant development decisions that go beyond the scope of our regular updates. Our next blog article will dive into it.
