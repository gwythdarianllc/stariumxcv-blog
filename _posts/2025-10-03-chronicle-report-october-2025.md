Hey everyone!

It’s been a month of progress and a few bumps, and we have something new to show you: an early look at the new UI. It’s still in the building stage, but we thought it was time to share where things are headed.

But first, let’s talk about the elephant in the server room.

#### Wiki and AWS Woes
Our wiki, also known as The Travellers Guide, has been going down frequently. You have probably noticed that some links just… don’t. Between bot attacks, the occasional 502 Bad Gateway monster, and the general chaos that comes with AWS (seriously, people make whole careers out of just wrangling that beast), things have been rocky.

The good news is that we are on it. Our devs are elbow deep in the configs, poking at every setting they can find. The bad news is that it will still be a little bumpy until we tame it. If you have clicked something lately and thought, “huh, that’s broken,” you are not wrong. Take this as our confirmation that we see the issue and are working to resolve it.


#### Our First UI Preview
Here it is, our debut reveal of the new UI.

What you see below is the blocking, layout, and architecture of the interface. This stage is about building the structure and modules that make everything work. Skins, or themes as some call them, will also be a big feature of the game, and we are building these in tandem with the UI. The visual personality will continue to grow as we move from structure to style.

That’s all for now. Thanks for sticking with us through the growing pains and celebrating the big steps forward with us.
