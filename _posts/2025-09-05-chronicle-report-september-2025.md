Genesis is receiving major upgrades that make it easier to build our galaxies, and the Heraldry Designer is redesigned with new features.

#### Genesis: Expanded Capabilities
Genesis, the engine that creates StariumXCV’s game universe, generates more detail than ever before. The newly updated process includes:

- Planets with unique traits

- NPC empires complete with their own histories and identities.

- Vast galaxies filled with more than 100,000 empires to encounter!

We are currently streamlining the deployment process so that launching new playable game spaces will be faster, cleaner, and more reliable.

#### Heraldry Designer: A Fresh Look
Our Heraldry Designer has undergone a makeover:

- New interface: cleaner, sharper, and easier to navigate, making the tool more approachable for first-time creators.

- High resolution output: heraldry is now saved at three times the previous resolution, providing crisp, detailed banners for your empire.

- Save & upload: you can now design your heraldry, save your work, and upload it directly into the game.

Here’s a preview of the new Heraldry Designer:

September’s updates bring to life both the cosmos and your identity within it.
